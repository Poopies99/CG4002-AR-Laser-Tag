This is the final version of the source code for a 2-player laser-tag system. 

## Setup
1. The Arduino scripts for the hardware componenets are found under the `hardware` directory
2. The setup for the internal and external communications for the system can be found separately in `README`s of the `internal_comms` and `external_comms` directories.
