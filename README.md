# CG4002 Computer Engineering Capstone Project

### Group B14

This is the final version of the source code for a 2-player laser-tag system. 

## Setup
1. The Arduino scripts for the Bluno Beetles can be found under the `hardware` directory
2. The setup for the internal and external communications for the system can be found separately in `README`s of the `internal_comms` and `external_comms` directories.
3. Download the software visualiser apk file found in the `visualiser` directory onto 2 separate Android devices. 

## Running the program

It is recommended that the whole program be run on a single laptop running Ubuntu Desktop 22.04. However, the use of 2 laptops to run the internal and external communications scripts respectively is also possible. Ensure that the necessary dependencies for running each script on the laptop are met. 

1. Run the external communications script in one terminal.
2. Power up all the Bluno Beetles.
3. Run the internal communications script.
4. Run the software visualiser with the downloaded apk file.
5. Play on and have fun!:)
